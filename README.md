# 🚀 Road Network Optimization & Routing Evaluation System

## 📌 Problem
Raw road network data from OpenStreetMap contains excessive node density due to micro-segmentation and mapping artifacts. This significantly increases computational cost for routing and large-scale simulations without improving accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Solution

This project builds a **graph simplification and evaluation pipeline** that reduces structural complexity while preserving routing correctness.

It:
- Simplifies topology (removes redundant nodes & micro edges)
- Preserves connectivity using largest connected component
- Benchmarks routing performance before and after simplification
